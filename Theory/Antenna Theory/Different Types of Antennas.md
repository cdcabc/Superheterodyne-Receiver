| **[[Dipole Antenna]]**         | A simple, straight antenna that is often used as a basic reference antenna. It consists of two equal-length conductors.                    |
| **[[Monopole Antenna]]**       | A single conductor above a ground plane, often used in mobile communication systems.                                                       |
| **Yagi-Uda Antenna**           | A directional antenna with multiple elements (a driven element, reflector, and director). It is used for high gain in specific directions. |
| **Parabolic (Dish) Antenna**   | A highly directional antenna with a parabolic reflector, used in satellite communication and radio telescopes.                             |
| **Helical Antenna**            | A spiral-shaped antenna, often used for satellite communication, known for circular polarization.                                          |
| **Log-Periodic Antenna**       | A directional antenna with multiple elements of different sizes, designed to cover a wide frequency range.                                 |
| **Patch (Microstrip) Antenna** | A low-profile antenna typically used in mobile devices and GPS systems. It consists of a flat metal patch on a dielectric substrate.       |
| **Loop Antenna**               | A closed-loop antenna often used for low-frequency applications. Can be used in both transmission and reception.                           |
| **Whip Antenna**               | A flexible, monopole antenna often used in mobile radios, commonly seen in car radios.                                                     |
| **Horn Antenna**               | A type of antenna shaped like a horn, used for microwave frequencies and often employed in radar applications.                             |
| **Slot Antenna**               | A type of antenna formed by a slot in a conductor, often used in high-frequency applications like radar.                                   |
| **Discone Antenna**            | A broadband antenna that combines a cone and disk shape, typically used in wideband applications.                                          |
| **Patch Array Antenna**        | An array of microstrip patch antennas arranged to form a larger, high-gain antenna system.                                                 |
| **Fractal Antenna**            | An antenna designed using fractal shapes to provide multiband and compact size for applications like mobile communications.                |
