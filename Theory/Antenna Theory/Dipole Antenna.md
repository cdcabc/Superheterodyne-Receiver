A **dipole antenna** is one of the simplest and most widely used types of antennas, commonly used in radio communication. It's essentially a straight conductor that is split into two halves, creating two "poles," hence the name "dipole.".

### Structure:
- **Length**: The total length of a typical dipole antenna is approximately half the wavelength (λ/2) of the frequency it is designed to transmit or receive. For example, for a 100 MHz frequency, the wavelength is around 3 meters, so the dipole would be approximately 1.5 meters long, with each leg of the dipole being 0.75 meters.
- **Shape**: The antenna consists of two conductive elements (often made of metal) that are aligned in a straight line, usually parallel to the ground. These elements are fed at the center with a signal source.
### Working Principle:
- **[[Resonance]]**: A dipole antenna works most efficiently when its length is resonant with the wavelength of the signal. At resonance, the antenna's impedance matches that of the transmission line, resulting in maximum power transfer.
- **Radiation Pattern**: When an alternating current (AC) is applied at the center of the dipole, the electric charge oscillates, causing the antenna to emit electromagnetic waves. The radiation pattern of a dipole antenna is typically doughnut-shaped, with the strongest radiation occurring perpendicular to the antenna's axis and weaker radiation along the axis of the dipole.
- **[[Polarization]]**: The polarization of the antenna is linear, meaning the electromagnetic waves are radiated in a direction parallel to the antenna. If the antenna is placed vertically, the radiated waves will be vertically polarized, and if it’s horizontal, the waves will be horizontally polarized.
### Types of Dipole Antennas:
- **Half-wave Dipole**: This is the most common form of dipole antenna, where the total length of the antenna is half the wavelength (λ/2) of the frequency it’s designed for.
- **Quarter-wave Dipole**: A variation of the half-wave dipole, but with a length of a quarter of the wavelength, used in certain specialized designs.
### Applications:
- **Broadcasting**: Dipole antennas are widely used in broadcasting and receiving radio and television signals.
- **Communication Systems**: They are used in various communication devices such as ham radios, wireless networks, and radar systems.
### Advantages:
- Simple and inexpensive to construct.
- Effective over a range of frequencies when properly designed.
- Produces a strong directional pattern in the horizontal plane (especially for a half-wave dipole).
### Limitations:
- Requires an open area for installation to be most effective.
- Its omnidirectional radiation pattern means it’s less ideal for focused, long-range communications compared to more complex antennas like parabolic dishes.

| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**              | A type of antenna with two conductive elements, typically half the wavelength in total length. | A theoretical antenna that radiates equally in all directions (idealized).            |
| **Radiation Pattern**       | Bi-directional, doughnut-shaped radiation pattern, strongest perpendicular to the antenna.     | Omnidirectional in 3D, radiating equally in all directions.                           |
| **Physical Structure**      | Two metal elements (usually rods) aligned in a straight line.                                  | No physical structure — a conceptual ideal, not a real-world antenna.                 |
| **Polarization**            | Linear polarization (depends on orientation of the antenna).                                   | No physical polarization, but the radiation is evenly distributed in all directions.  |
| **Real-world Usage**        | Widely used in practical applications like radio, TV, and wireless communication.              | Used for theoretical modeling or as a reference for antenna gain and efficiency.      |
| **Efficiency**              | Practical, efficient in specific conditions (resonant frequencies).                            | Hypothetical, serves as a standard for measuring other antennas' efficiency and gain. |
| **Gain**                    | Typically has a gain of around 2.15 dB in the direction of maximum radiation.                  | Defined as 0 dB gain in all directions (ideal reference).                             |
| **Size**                    | Usually half the wavelength of the frequency it’s tuned for.                                   | No size (idealized, doesn’t have a physical form).                                    |
| **Beamwidth**               | Narrower in the direction perpendicular to the antenna, wider along its axis.                  | 360° in all directions, no beamwidth because it’s omnidirectional.                    |
| **Directivity**             | Moderate directivity, strongest perpendicular to the antenna.                                  | None, as it radiates equally in all directions.                                       |
| **Applications**            | Used in radio transmission, broadcasting, and wireless communication.                          | Not used in practical applications, but serves as a reference for antenna theory.     |
| **Construction Complexity** | Simple to construct, easy to implement.                                                        | No physical construction — a theoretical model.                                       |
