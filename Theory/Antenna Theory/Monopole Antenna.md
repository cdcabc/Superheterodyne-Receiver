A **monopole antenna** is one of the simplest types of radio antennas. It consists of a **single conductor**, usually a straight wire or rod, mounted **perpendicular to a conductive surface** (the **ground plane**).

####  **Key Features:**
- Acts like **half of a dipole antenna**.
- Typically mounted above a ground plane.
- The image of the monopole in the ground plane acts like the second half of a dipole.
- Often used in **AM radio**, **mobile communications**, **broadcasting**, and **vehicle-mounted antennas**.
#### **Typical Length:**
- A common type is the **quarter-wave monopole**:
    L=λ/4 
    Where λ is the wavelength of the signal.
####  **Radiation Pattern:**
- Omnidirectional in the horizontal plane (i.e., it radiates equally in all directions).
- Doughnut-shaped pattern in 3D.
