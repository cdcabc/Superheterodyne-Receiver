In terms of antennas, **"isotropic"** refers to an **idealized point source** that radiates electromagnetic energy **equally in all directions**—that is, it has **uniform radiation intensity** in every direction in 3D space.

An isotropic antenna is a theoretical antenna that radiates equally in all directions - horizontally and vertically with the same intensity. The antenna has a gain of 1 (0 dB) in the spherical space all around it and has an efficiency of 100%. An isotropic antenna is used as a reference antenna to evaluate antenna gain.

In terms of mathematical model:

- These are **polar plots**, which show how signal strength varies with direction around the antenna.
- **Perfect circles** in both plots indicate that the antenna radiates **equally in all directions**, both horizontally and vertically.

### Key Points:
- An **isotropic antenna** is a **theoretical construct**; it doesn’t exist in real life.
- It's often used as a **reference** to compare real antennas.
- The radiation pattern of an isotropic antenna is a perfect **sphere**.
- It has **0 dBi gain** (decibels over isotropic), meaning it neither amplifies nor focuses energy in any specific direction.
