### **AM vs FM Radio: Comparison Table**

| **Aspect**                      | **AM (Amplitude Modulation)**                            | **FM (Frequency Modulation)**                         |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Modulation Technique**        | Varies amplitude of the carrier wave                     | Varies frequency of the carrier wave                  |
| **Frequency Range**             | 540 kHz – 1700 kHz                                       | 88 MHz – 108 MHz                                      |
| **Bandwidth**                   | ~10 kHz                                                  | ~200 kHz                                              |
| **Audio Quality**               | Lower fidelity; prone to static and noise                | Higher fidelity; clear and crisp sound                |
| **Interference Susceptibility** | More susceptible (e.g., electrical noise, weather, etc.) | Less susceptible; resistant to amplitude-based noise  |
| **Signal Propagation**          | Ground and skywave; long-range, especially at night      | Line-of-sight; limited to local/regional areas        |
| **Coverage Area**               | Larger; effective in rural/remote regions                | Smaller; best suited for urban/suburban regions       |
| **Equipment Complexity**        | Simpler transmitters and receivers                       | Requires more complex equipment                       |
| **Common Uses**                 | News, talk shows, sports commentary                      | Music, entertainment, high-fidelity audio content     |
| **Advantages**                  | Wide coverage; effective for emergency broadcasts        | Superior sound quality; less static; better for music |
| **Disadvantages**               | Poor sound quality; high interference                    | Limited range; higher setup and maintenance cost      |
| **Future Outlook**              | Declining in favor of digital platforms                  | Still popular but also transitioning to digital       |

Definition of Carrier Wave:
**Carrier Wave**: is a high-frequency electromagnetic wave that is used to carry information (like audio, video, or data) from one place to another. The actual information signal (which is typically low-frequency) is modulated onto this carrier wave so it can be transmitted efficiently over long distances.

Typically this would come in the form of a modulated sine wave, there are different forms of modulation that can occur depending on their application:

---

|Type of Modulation|What Changes in the Carrier?|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**Amplitude Modulation (AM)**|Amplitude (height of the wave)|The wave gets taller or shorter depending on the message signal|
|**Frequency Modulation (FM)**|Frequency (how fast the wave wiggles)|The wave speeds up or slows down based on the message signal|
|**Phase Modulation (PM)**|Phase (wave shift left or right)|The wave’s position shifts slightly to encode the message|
