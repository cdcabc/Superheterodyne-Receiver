Very Basic Explanation of what RF is and what it can be categorized into:

| **Use Category**         | **Description**                                                                                                                  | **Examples**                                                                                   |

| **Heating Objects**      | RF is used to heat materials for various purposes in domestic, industrial, and medical contexts.                                 | Microwave ovens, industrial heating, medical diathermy                                         |
| **Sensing/Detection**    | RF signals are transmitted and their reflections or changes are analyzed to gather information about objects they interact with. | Radar, motion sensors, object detection                                                        |
| **Information Transfer** | RF is used to carry data over distances, enabling the transmission of sound, images, and digital data.                           | Radio, TV broadcasts, Wi-Fi, cellular networks, Bluetooth, satellite communication (e.g., GPS) |

Naturally the two that we will be focusing on is Information Transfer and potentially Sensing/Detection depending on decisions and discussions.
