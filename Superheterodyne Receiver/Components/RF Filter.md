In a superheterodyne receiver, the RF filter before the mixer is typically a band-pass filter, which plays a crucial role in ensuring that only the desired signal reaches the mixer. The filter is designed to allow a narrow range of frequencies centered around the desired radio frequency to pass through, while rejecting all other unwanted frequencies. This includes blocking the image frequency â€” an unwanted signal that, after mixing, would produce the same intermediate frequency as the desired RF signal. By using a band-pass filter, the receiver effectively eliminates the potential for interference from the image frequency, ensuring that only the correct RF signal enters the mixer.

The band-pass filter helps prevent the mixing of unwanted signals, such as the image frequency, which could otherwise cause false or misleading IF signals. Without this filtering, the receiver might accidentally process the image signal instead of the desired signal. Thus, the RF band-pass filter is a key component in maintaining the accuracy and performance of the superheterodyne receiver, allowing it to isolate and amplify the signal of interest without interference from other frequencies.
