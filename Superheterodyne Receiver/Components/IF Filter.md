The IF filter allows only the desired intermediate frequency to pass through. It removes unwanted frequencies, noise, and interference that may have been generated during the mixing process, ensuring that the signal processed after the mixer is clean and free from any extraneous components. By doing so, the IF filter enables efficient amplification and demodulation of the signal, which are essential for accurate signal recovery.

In most superheterodyne receivers, a band-pass filter is used for the IF stage. This type of filter not only selects the desired IF but also defines the bandwidth of the signal that is allowed to pass through. The bandwidth of the IF filter is crucial because it determines the range of frequencies around the IF that are preserved, influencing the receiverâ€™s ability to reject interference while ensuring that the complete signal is passed without distortion.
