The mixer combines the incoming radio frequency signal with a signal from a [[Local Oscillator]] to produce new signals at different frequencies, specifically, the sum and difference of the two. Most of the time, the mixer is used to reduce the frequency to a lower intermediate frequency. This is done to make the signal easier to amplify, filter, and demodulate, and to avoid issues that commonly occur when working directly at high RF frequencies.

This Produces two frequencies (sum and difference of the two frequencies going into the mixer) the higher frequency is filtered out in the [[IF Filter]] which in most cases is a bandpass filter. Due to it producing two frequencies, a second unwanted frequency (Image signal) will also have a frequency that overlaps, this should be filtered out in the [[RF Filter]].
