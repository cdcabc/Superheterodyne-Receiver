The demodulator is mainly used to recover the original information content from the modulated carrier wave by analyzing how the carrier's properties were changed during transmission.

- When the signal was first _transmitted_ (at the radio station, for example), the original information — like someone speaking — was used to _modify_ a carrier wave (by changing its amplitude, frequency, or phase).
    
- That modification is what lets the signal travel long distances efficiently.
    
- However, by the time it reaches your radio receiver, you don't directly have the clean voice or music anymore — you only have the **carrier wave that was changed**.
    
- The **demodulator "undoes"** that modification — it carefully reads those changes and **reconstructs the original sound** or data signal.
    

**So:**

- Before modulation: pure voice or music (original information from transmitter).
    
- After modulation: hidden inside a high-frequency wave (carrier).
    
- After demodulation: pure voice or music again (restored information).
