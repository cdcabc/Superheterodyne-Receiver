To make it so there is a common repo between us you want to make a folder on your desktop and name it anything
![[Pasted image 20250424000352.png]]
In the above my main folder for the project is Class Notes

Inside the folder right click and there should be a pop up with the first option being View. At the very bottom click the "Show more options button"

The https link comes from the Github repository that I created, this can be viewed by opening up the below link:

This is the view you will see:

If you click on the green <Code> button it will display the below:
![[Pasted image 20250424001304.png]]

From there it will create a folder within your existing folder that will be named "Superheterodyne-Receiver"

Inside of that folder should be all the current notes that exist for the project currently.

Once you begin editing the notes or adding things of your own and you want to save them to the communal github, within the "Superheterodyne-Receiver" folder you want to open up a gitbash terminal within that folder.

Type git status and it will display all the changes you have made:

Next if you want add all changes type git add --all:
